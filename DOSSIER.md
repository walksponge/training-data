| 1 | Excellent (fully recovered) |
| 2 | Good (normal fatigue) |
| 3 | Moderate (manageable tiredness) |
| 4 | Fatigued (reduced readiness, deload trigger) |
| 5 | Exhausted (complete rest required) |

| [Year] | [Focus] | [W] | [W/kg] | [Metrics] |
| [Year] | [Focus] | [W] | [W/kg] | [Metrics] |

### Event-Specific Targets (Optional)

| Event/Segment | Year | Priority | Target Time | Target Power |
|---------------|------|----------|-------------|--------------|
| [Event] | [Year] | [A/B/C] | [Time] | [W] |
| [Event] | [Year] | [A/B/C] | [Time] | [W] |

> **Race tagging for automated protocol activation:** Tag races in Intervals.icu as `RACE_A`, `RACE_B`, or `RACE_C` using the event category selector. The race-week protocol (Section 11A) activates automatically for A and B races within 7 days. C races are training races — no taper adjustments. For best results, also set expected duration (`moving_time`) in the event to enable event-type modifiers (carb loading, opener intensity, TSB targets).
